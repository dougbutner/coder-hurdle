### About
Weâ€™re looking for someone to help us build tools for our dapp cXc.world and be on the team for upcoming project Tetra. First place finisher that meets all requirements gets 500k COP, and a job offer to work with us in Medellin with option remote work after first monthâ€™s real-life meetings. All finishers will get 100 [PURPLE](https://github.com/currentxchange/purple-explainer) (our cXc project token on WAX) currently worth about 50k COP

### Your Task
Create and deploy an IPFS app that allows users to login and send a transaction on the WAX block chain. The application should have a dark-theme UI. There should be a landing page with a login, and a logged-in page that displays empty field and a button. The user should be able to input a WAX address in the field, and clock the button which creates a signing request for a eosio.token::transfer action with the `from` as the logged in account and the `to` as the account typed in. Please use [WAX testnet](https://testnet.waxblock.io/). 

### Required Tech
- React
- Waxjs

### Rules

UI options must be free without pricing plans (no tailwind, etc)  
You have until the 9th of July to complete.  
If you need 5 wax to open a WAX account via mycloudwallet.com, please ask Alejandro (this is only to receive reward, there's no cost to make a [testnet account](https://waxsweden.org/create-testnet-account/) and use [Anchor](https://www.greymass.com/anchor) login to test the app)
